# BLIS Consulting

We are available for paid support and feature development on the [C4G BLIS project](https://blis.cc.gatech.edu/). **BLIS is free software**, but we can provide specific help for your use of BLIS for a fee.

## Services

Some services we can offer are:

* Walk-through and initial setup
* Ad-hoc one-on-one support video calls
* Feature development
* Running BLIS on the cloud

## Who are we?

### Mitchell Rysavy

Mitchell has been one of the primary developers on this project since 2022. His largest contributions have been to create the online, cloud-based version of BLIS (BLIS-on-Docker) and the ["blis" tool](https://github.com/C4G/blis-cloud-cli) for administering it.

### Sidney Akuro Atah

Sidney has been with the BLIS project since the beginning. He has worked with many labs in Cameroon to set up and support BLIS, and has been a part of studies about BLIS as it has evolved.
